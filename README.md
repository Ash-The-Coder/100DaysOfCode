# 100DaysOfCode
---

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! This repository documents my daily progress as I work on coding projects for 100 consecutive days.

# Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to hold myself accountable and improve my coding skills by consistently working on projects for an extended period of time. By committing to coding for at least an hour every day, I hope to become a better programmer and build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my abilities.

# Rules
The rules of the challenge are as follows:

- Code for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days
- Document my daily progress in this repository

# Projects
Throughout the challenge, I will be working on a variety of coding projects, including:

- Web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Python scripting projects
- Data analysis projects using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy
and much more

# Progress
To track my progress, I will be documenting my daily coding sessions in this repository. Each day, I will create a folder with a brief summary of what I worked on and what I learned. I will also include any code snippets or screenshots that are relevant to my progress.

# Conclusion
I'm excited to embark on this 100 Days of Code challenge and see how much I can accomplish in the next 100 days. Thank you for following along with my progress!
