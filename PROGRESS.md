# 100 Days Of Code Daily Progress

## Day 1: Email Subscription Script

Today, I started my 100 Days of Code challenge by working on an email subscription script. The script allows users to subscribe to a newsletter and sends them a confirmation email. Here's a summary of what I accomplished today:

- Created a Python script named `email-subscription.py` to handle the email subscription process.
- Imported the `smtplib` module to establish a connection with the SMTP server.
- Set up my email and password variables with the appropriate values.
- Initialized an SMTP connection with the Office 365 server using `smtplib.SMTP`.
- Secured the connection using `starttls()` to enable encryption.
- Logged into the SMTP server using my email and password with `connection.login()`.
- Sent an email to the subscriber using `connection.sendmail()`, including a subject and message body.
- Closed the connection using `connection.close()`.

I'm excited to continue my coding journey and look forward to working on more projects in the coming days. Tomorrow, I plan to explore different ways to enhance this email subscription script. Stay tuned for more updates!

You can find the code for today's project on my GitHub repository:

Remember to personalize the message, email addresses, and other details according to your specific implementation. Good luck with your challenge!

## Day 2: Buzz Time Web App

Today, I worked on a web application called Buzz Time. It allows users to post and view buzzes in a Twitter-like interface. Here's what I accomplished:

- Updated the HTML template to reflect the new design with a dark blue and light blue color scheme.
- Modified the text entry section to be shorter and more visually appealing.
- Integrated the Flask framework to handle the server-side functionality.
- Implemented the ability to post buzzes and display them in a card-based format.

I'm thrilled with the progress I've made so far, and I'm excited to continue on with the challenge
