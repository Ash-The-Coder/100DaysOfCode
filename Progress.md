# 100 Days Of Code Daily Progress

**Day 1: Email Subscription Script**

Today, I started my 100 Days of Code challenge by working on an email subscription script. The script allows users to subscribe to a newsletter and sends them a confirmation email. Here's a summary of what I accomplished today:

- Created a Python script named `email-subscription.py` to handle the email subscription process.
- Imported the `smtplib` module to establish a connection with the SMTP server.
- Set up my email and password variables with the appropriate values.
- Initialized an SMTP connection with the Office 365 server using `smtplib.SMTP`.
- Secured the connection using `starttls()` to enable encryption.
- Logged into the SMTP server using my email and password with `connection.login()`.
- Sent an email to the subscriber using `connection.sendmail()`, including a subject and message body.
- Closed the connection using `connection.close()`.

I'm excited to continue my coding journey and look forward to working on more projects in the coming days. Tomorrow, I plan to explore different ways to enhance this email subscription script. Stay tuned for more updates!

Remember to personalize the message, email addresses, and other details according to your specific implementation. Good luck with your challenge!
